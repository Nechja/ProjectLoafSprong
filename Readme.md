# Welcome to LoafSprong!

This is the home P-6E image hosting. Here at LoafSprong, we're dedicated to the singular, noble cause of hosting an image of this majestic flying machine. Why? Because we bring **the glory of LoafSprong**!

## What's This All About?

The LoafSprong container is an **under**-engineered, questionably available, and probs pretty scalable solution for hosting a single image. It's a testament to nothingness, and a ~~great way to learn some stuff I'm sure is VERY Important.~~

## How to Use This Container
1. Ask yourself why
2. Fear
3. Pull the image from Docker Hub:

   ```
   docker pull bansidhe/loafsprong
    ```
    Run the container
    ```
    docker run -d -p 80:80 bansidhe/loafsprong
    ```

    Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost. You will be greeted by the glory of LOAFSPRONG.

## Why?

- [x] idfk

Because sometimes, you need to deploy an entire container to host a single image. Perhaps don't let your memes be dreams. Maybe it's to learn something new? Or maybe, just maybe, it's a bit of both.
Learnings. Seriously I needed a container to test some things with deployment, so this way to stupid thing was made.


## Disclaimer

No actual P-6 aircraft were harmed in the making of this container.

Feel like adding to the absurdity?
